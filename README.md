### My Personal Roadmap to Mastering ML with Python

Welcome to my learning paced repository! In this repo, I document my hands on journey through the fascinating world of Machine Learning. I've built it as a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks so you can follow along with every step I took from cleaning data to building and evaluating powerful models.

### 🤔 Why I'm Learning Machine Learning

I believe that in today's world, data is the new oil, and Machine Learning is the engine that turns that oil into power. From recommending our next Netflix binge to helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier, ML is reshaping our world, and I wanted to be a part of it.

For me, learning ML is more than just a career move; it's a way to develop powerful problem solving skills and understand the technology that's shaping our future.

> **My Goal:** To move from being a consumer of AI to a creator of it.

### 📂 What I've Included in the Notebooks

In this repository, I've included where I explore different machine learning concepts and algorithms through practical examples.

<div align="center">

| Section | What I've Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔹 **Data Preprocessing** | How I handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and scaled features. |
| 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis** | The stunning visualizations I created to uncover insights, distributions, and correlations. |
| 🧠 **Supervised Learning** | My implementations of Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more. |
| 🤖 **Unsupervised Learning** | How I used K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to discover hidden groups in data. |
| ✅ **Model Evaluation** | The methods I used to measure performance, like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. |

### 💾 The Datasets I've Used

I believe a machine learning journey is best traveled with diverse data. For this project, I used a variety of datasets to practice different ML tasks:

*   **`Churn_Modelling.csv`**: A classic classification problem where I predicted customer churn.
*   **`Diabetes.csv`**: Predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
*   **`Housing_Data.csv`**: A regression task where I predicted housing prices.
*   **`Iris.csv`**: My take on the "Hello, World!" of classification, identifying iris flower species.
*   **`Loan.csv` & `Train_Loan.csv`**: Predicting loan eligibility.
*   **`Placement_Dataset.csv`**: Forecasting student job placement success.
*   **`Social_Network_Ads.csv`**: Predicting purchase decisions based on user data.
*   **`Nonlinear_Data_Circles.csv`**: Used to visualize how certain algorithms handle non-linear data.

### 🔮 My Future Scope & What's Next

My journey doesn't end here! I plan to expand this project to include:

*   **Deep Learning:** An introduction to Neural Networks.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring how agents learn to make decisions.
*   **Generative AI:** A glimpse into the models that create new content.

### ⚙️ How to Get Started

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Chetannrevankar/Journey_With_MachineLearning.git
    cd Journey_With_MachineLearning
    ```

2.  **Run the Notebooks**
    I've included two main notebooks. I recommend starting with `MachineLearning_Part1.ipynb` for a broad overview, then moving to `Churn_Modeling.ipynb` for my deep-dive case study.

    ```
    # For my general introduction to various ML models
    jupyter notebook MachineLearning_Part1.ipynb
