### My Personal Roadmap to Mastering ML with Python

Welcome to my learning-paced repository! In this repo, I document my hands-on journey through the fascinating world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I've built it as a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks so you can follow along with every step I took‚Äîfrom cleaning data to building and evaluating powerful models.

### ü§î Why I'm Learning Machine Learning

I believe that in today's world, data is the new oil, and **Machine Learning** is the engine that turns that oil into power. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. From recommending our next Netflix binge to helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier, ML is reshaping our world, and I wanted to be a part of it.

For me, learning ML is more than just a career move; it's a way to develop powerful problem-solving skills and understand the technology that's shaping our future.

> **My Goal:** To move from being a consumer of AI to a creator of it.

### üìÇ What I've Included in the Notebooks

In this repository, I've included notebooks where I explore different machine learning concepts and algorithms through practical examples.

<div align="center">

| Section | What I've Covered |
| :---: | :--- |
| üîπ **Data Preprocessing** | How I handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and scaled features. |
| üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis** | The stunning visualizations I created to uncover insights, distributions, and correlations. |
| üß† **Supervised Learning** | My implementations of Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more. |
| ü§ñ **Unsupervised Learning** | How I used K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to discover hidden groups in data. |
| ‚úÖ **Model Evaluation** | The methods I used to measure performance, like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. |

### üß† My Deep Learning Exploration

As my journey progressed, I dived into **Deep Learning**, a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to model and understand complex patterns in data. Below are the core concepts I've explored, starting from the fundamentals and moving toward advanced topics.

<div align="center">

| Topic | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Perceptron** | The simplest form of a neural network, a single neuron that takes inputs, applies weights, and uses an activation function to produce a binary output. |
| **Neural Network (NN)** | A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. |
| **Gradient Descent** | An optimization algorithm used to minimize a model's cost function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the gradient. |
| **Weight Updation Formula** | The core of learning in NNs. It's the rule (e.g., `new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate * gradient`) used to adjust weights during training. |
| **Chain Rule of Differentiation** | A fundamental calculus rule essential for **backpropagation**, allowing us to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. |
| **Vanishing Gradient Problem**| A challenge in deep networks where gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, effectively stopping the learning process for early layers. |
| **Activation Function (AF)** | A function applied to the output of a neuron to introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. Examples include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh. |
| **Loss Function & Cost Function** | A **Loss Function** measures the error for a single training example, while a **Cost Function** is the average loss over the entire training dataset. |
| **Optimizers** | Algorithms that modify the attributes of the neural network, such as weights and learning rate, to reduce the overall loss. Examples include Adam, SGD, and RMSprop. |
| **TensorFlow** | An open-source library developed by Google for building and training machine learning models, especially deep neural networks. |
| **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** | A classic feedforward neural network, often used for tabular data and regression/classification tasks. |
| **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | A specialized deep neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. It uses convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features. |
| **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** | A type of neural network designed to handle sequential data (e.g., time series or text) by using its internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. |
| **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** | An advanced type of RNN architecture that is designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing it to remember information for longer periods. |
| **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | An advanced architecture that combines a pre-trained language model with an external knowledge retrieval system to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. |
| **Fine-Tuning (FT)** | The process of taking a pre-trained model (like one trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) and retraining it on a smaller, specific dataset to adapt it to a new task. |

### üöÄ Projects Associated with These Topics

- **Deep Dive into CNNs:** [**Smart Spoon Food Recognition System**](https://github.com/Chetannrevankar/Smart_Spoon_FoodRecognitionSystem) - A project where I built and fine-tuned a CNN (MobileNetV2) for image classification.
- **Classic ANN for Classification:** [**Churn Modeling Case Study**](https://github.com/Chetannrevankar/Journey_With_MachineLearning/blob/main/Churn_Modeling.ipynb) - My implementation of an ANN to predict customer churn from tabular data.

### üíæ The Datasets I've Used
I believe a machine learning journey is best traveled with diverse data. For this project, I used a variety of datasets to practice different ML tasks:
*   **`Churn_Modelling.csv`**: A classic classification problem where I predicted customer churn.
*   **`Diabetes.csv`**: Predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
*   **`Housing_Data.csv`**: A regression task where I predicted housing prices.
*   **`Iris.csv`**: My take on the "Hello, World!" of classification, identifying iris flower species.
*   **`Loan.csv` & `Train_Loan.csv`**: Predicting loan eligibility.
*   **`Placement_Dataset.csv`**: Forecasting student job placement success.
*   **`Social_Network_Ads.csv`**: Predicting purchase decisions based on user data.
*   **`Nonlinear_Data_Circles.csv`**: Used to visualize how certain algorithms handle non-linear data.

### üîÆ My Future Scope & What's Next
My journey doesn't end here! I plan to expand this project to include:
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring how agents learn to make decisions.
*   **Generative AI:** A deeper dive into the models that create new content.
*   **Advanced RAG applications:** Building more sophisticated Q&A systems.
